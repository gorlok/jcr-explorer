> Note from original author:
> Moved this project over from SourceForge where it resided since 06/04/2007. I'm not actively maintaining this anymore but since people still seem to download it and even get in touch with me, I thought I'd just move it over here. Anyways, who's putting projects on SourceForge anymore these days... ;)
